# Business-Owners-in-the-United-States

# Introduction
For this project, we analyzed data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, which is sponsored by the Federal Reserve in the United States. The survey provides financial, demographic, and opinion information for American households. Our main objective was to create a model that would help us divide households into subgroups.

To achieve our goal, we first loaded the dataset and performed exploratory data analysis. We investigated characteristics such as age, race, income, assets, and education, with a focus on households that are defined as business owners. 

Next, we built an unsupervised machine-learning model that segmented these households into clusters. We then examined the differences between these clusters and drew insights from the findings. 

Finally, we created an interactive web app to present our work, allowing users to explore the clusters and interact with the data.
